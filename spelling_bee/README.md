## Unique Spelling Bees
Given that the New York Times game [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) is setup as follows:
* $7$ unique letters are selected from the English alphabet,
* $6$ of the letters - the outer letters - are arranged in a hexagon, and $1$ is in the center
* The order of the outer letters does not matter.
* **S** cannot be used
* At least $1$ of the letters must be **A**, **E**, **I**, **O**, or **U**.
