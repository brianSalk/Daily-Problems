## Numbers with Ascending Subsequence of Length 3
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived by removing some (or no) elements of a given sequence **without** changing the order.  
For example, the sequence of $(1,3,2,4,3)$ has subsequence $(1,2,3)$.  
If we view an $N$ digit number as a sequence of digits,
