## Grab Markers (a problem from Joy Morris's book Combinatorics)
I have four markers on my desk: one blue and three black.  Every day on my way to  
class, I grab three of the markers without looking.  There are four different markers  
that could be left behind, so there are four combinations of markers that I could take   
with me.  
### A) What is the prabability that I take the blue marker?
### B) What is my probability of grabbing at least one blue marker if I have 5 markers, 3 black and 2 and I take 3?
### C) What is my probability of grabbing at least one blue marker if I grab 3 of 6 markers where 2 are blue?
### Explaination
  * A: There are $4 \choose 3$  $=4$ ways to choose three markers from four and three of the four combinations contain a blue marker, so the answer is $\dfrac{3}{4}$
  * B: There are $5 \choose 3$ $=10$ ways to choose three markers from five, and there is only one combination that only contains black markers, so the answer is $\dfrac{10 - 1}{10}=\dfrac{9}{10}$
  * C: There are $6 \choose 3$ $=20$ ways to choose three markers from 6, and there are $4 \choose 3$ $=4$ ways to choose only black markers, so the answer is $\dfrac{20-4}{20}=\dfrac{4}{5}$
