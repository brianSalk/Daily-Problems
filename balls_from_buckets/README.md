Each time you roll a $5$ or lower on a six sided die, you pick a ball from a bucket.

If each time you select a ball, you put it back into the bucket before rolling the die again  
### What is the probability that you select:
<details>
  $\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^4 \cdot \dfrac{1}{6} \approx .0804$
  <summary>Exactly $4$ balls of either color?</summary>

<details>
  $\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^4 \cdot \dfrac{1}{6} \cdot (\dfrac{2}{3})^3 (\dfrac{1}{3})$
  <summary>Exactly $4$ balls, <b>blue,blue,red,blue</b>, in that order?</summary>
</details>
