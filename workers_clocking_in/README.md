## Workers Clocking In
There is a small grocery store with $9$ employees.  Each week-day, all employees arrive before 9:00 am and clock into a computer.  
Strangly, the order in which each employee arrives is totally random every day and everyone has perfect attendance.  
### What is the probability that:
<details><summary><b>A) </b> the same person shows up first $2$ days in a row?</summary></details>
<details><summary><b>B) </b>exactly $2$ people show up in the same order $2$ days in a row?</summary></details>
<details><summary><b>C) </b> everybody shows up in a different order than they did the previous day?</summary></details>

## Explaination
### Part A
regardless of who showed up yesterday, there will be a probability of $$\dfrac{1}{9}$$ that the same person will show up first the next day because only $1$ person can be first and there are $9$ people total.  
### Part B
