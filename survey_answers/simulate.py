40 people took a quick two question survey, 
25 people said they thought climate change was a big problem, 
and 10 thought wealth inequality was a big problem.
Assuming that these two opinioins are not correlated (bad assumption in real life), what is the probability that exactly 4 people think that both climate change and weath inequality are a big problem?
