## Vowel Probabilities

### What is the probability of selecting exactly $3$ vowels from the English alphabet if we select $10$ letters and:
<details>Use binomial Distribution<summary><b>A) </b>We are allowed to select letters more than once</summary></details>
<details>Use hypergeometric distribution<summary><b>B) </b>We are not allowed to select letters more than once</summary></details>

### For the sake of this excercise, we will assume $Y$ is a vowel and all $26$ letters are selected with equal probability.


#### Part A - selecting with replacement.
