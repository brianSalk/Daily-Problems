## The dyslexic Brian
Brian is dyslexic.  He knows what letters are in his name, but he often writes the letters out of order.  
He also often writes letters backwards.  
<details><summary>How many ways might Brian write his name?</summary>
$5! \cdot 2^4$</details>

### Solution
Because there are $5$ letters in the name 'Brian', there are
```math
5!
```
permutations of his name.  
Because there are $4$ letters that can be written either forwards or backwards ('i' can only be written one way),  
there are
```math
2^4 \cdot 5!
```
ways that he might write his name
